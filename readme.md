Competitive hot-seat platform game by mcalus.

**ColorWars** is my first attempt to fulfil my dreams about being a game developer. The idea started from simple website game that i liked very much, but it lacked multiplayer to have fun with my friends together.

The game rules are simple - get as much territory as possible and kill your enemies.

## Installation and dependencies

**ColorWars** is created in MonoGame, using OpenGl, so supported platforms are Windows, Linux and Mac. The game can be downloaded in release section on GitHub. To deploy on Linux and Mac Os, I have used [Kickstart project](https://github.com/OutOfOrder/MonoKickstart) to link the game with Mono libraries without installing them on target machine.

## Gameplay

**ColorWars** is in early phase of development, so there is no menu right now. Game parameters can be configured in settings.json file. Game will stop after time specified in settings, then you can quit by clicking enter or esc. The aim of the game is to have more territory than other players when game ends. You can kill enemy player by hitting his tail.
