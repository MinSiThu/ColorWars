Competitive hot-seat platform game by mcalus.

**ColorWars** is my first attempt to fulfil my dreams about being a game dev. The idea started from simple game that i liked very much, but it lacked multiplayer to make fun with my friends together.

## Installation and dependencies

ColorWars is created in MonoGame, using OpenGl, so supported platforms are Windows, Linux and Mac. As soon as alpha version will be released, the binaries will be available to download.
